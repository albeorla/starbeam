# Phase 2: Link Processing and Enrichment

## User Stories

1. **URL Ingestion:** As a user, I want to submit a URL (including YouTube videos, code repositories, and websites) and have the system automatically capture the key information and create a note from it.
2. **Link Type Detection:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect the type of link and process it accordingly.
3. **Content Summarization:** As a user, I want the system to automatically summarize the content of ingested links.
4. **Interactive Resource Embedding:** As a user, I want to interact with ingested resources directly within the knowledge base.
