# Phase 1: Core Functionality and Security

## User Stories

1. **User Authentication:** As a user, I want to securely access my notes and data with user authentication.
2. **Atomic Notes:** As a user, I want to create and store individual notes, each focused on a single idea or concept, so I can build a network of interconnected knowledge.
3. **Linking Notes:** As a user, I want to easily link notes together, creating relationships and connections between ideas.
4. **Backlinking:** As a user, I want to see all the notes that link to a specific note (backlinks), so I can understand the context and relationships of my ideas.
5. **Tagging/Contextualization:** As a user, I want to tag or categorize notes with keywords or contexts, so I can easily find and retrieve relevant information.
6. **Note Versioning:** As a user, I want to maintain a version history of my notes, so I can track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.

## Implementation Plan

1. **User Authentication (pages/api/auth):**
    - [ ] Implement user authentication using NextAuth.js or similar.
    - [ ] Secure API endpoints to require authentication where appropriate.

2. **Database Schema (schema.prisma):**
    - [ ] Design and implement the schema for **Users** and **Notes**, including fields for title, content, tags, and links.
    - [ ] Implement versioning for notes to track changes and maintain history.

3. **API Endpoints (pages/api):**
    - [ ] Create API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes.
    - [ ] Implement API routes for managing links between notes.
    - [ ] Implement API routes for handling note versioning.

4. **UI Implementation (pages/index.tsx, components):**
    - [ ] Create UI components for displaying and editing notes.
    - [ ] Implement UI elements for creating and managing links between notes.
    - [ ] Implement UI for tagging and filtering notes.
    - [ ] Implement UI for viewing and reverting note versions.

5. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    - [ ] Begin refining the UI/UX based on initial designs and user feedback.
