# Phase 4: Supporting Features and Enhancements

## User Stories

1. **Search:** As a user, I want to search my notes by keywords, tags, and content.
2. **Export/Import:** As a user, I want to export and import my notes in various formats (Markdown, JSON, etc.) for backup and portability.
3. **User Authentication:** As a user, I want to securely access my notes and data with user authentication.
4. **Interactive Resource UI:** As a user, I want an intuitive UI for interacting with embedded resources (e.g., YouTube videos, code repositories, websites) so I can explore and manipulate them as part of my knowledge base.
5. **HTTP Querying and Local Access:** As a user, I want to query the knowledge base via HTTP or access the processed artifacts stored on my local hardware system, so I can interact with my knowledge base both online and offline.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Search:**
    - [ ] Implement search functionality across notes, tags, and content.
2. **Export/Import:**
    - [ ] Implement export/import functionality in various formats.
3. **User Authentication:**
    - [ ] Implement user authentication using NextAuth.js or similar.
4. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    - [ ] Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback and testing.
5. **Pagination, Sorting, Filtering:**
    - [ ] Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering for notes.
6. **Link Validation:**
    - [ ] Implement URL validation on both frontend and backend.
7. **Interactive Resource UI:**
    - [ ] Design and implement a UI for interacting with embedded YouTube videos, code repositories, and websites.
    - [ ] Ensure that users can explore code repositories (e.g., view file structure, open files, link specific files or lines of code).
    - [ ] Ensure that users can play YouTube videos directly within the knowledge base.
    - [ ] Ensure that users can view and interact with websites directly within the knowledge base.
8. **HTTP Querying and Local Access:**
    - [ ] Implement an HTTP API for querying the knowledge base remotely.
    - [ ] Ensure that the HTTP API can query both notes and embedded resources (e.g., code repositories, videos, websites).
    - [ ] Implement local access to stored artifacts (e.g., code repositories, videos, websites) on the hardware system.
    - [ ] Ensure that local artifacts are accessible offline and can be linked to other notes or projects.
9. **Testing and QA:**
    - [ ] Implement unit and integration tests.
    - [ ] Perform manual testing and QA.
10. **Deployment and Monitoring:**
    - [ ] Set up staging environment, CI/CD pipeline, and monitoring tools.
11. **Documentation:**
    - [ ] Update documentation for all new features.
