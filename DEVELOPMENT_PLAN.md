# Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the core features of our link processing application.

## User Stories (P0 Goals)

1. As a user, I want to submit a URL to the system so that it can be processed and stored in my personal knowledge base system.
2. As a user, I want to see a confirmation message after submitting a link so that I know it was processed successfully.
3. As a user, I want the system to automatically detect the type of link I've submitted (GitHub, YouTube, or webpage) so that it can be processed appropriately.
4. As a developer, I need to add new link types with new processing rules easily over time. Preferably having an onboarding page for this process in the UI.
5. As a developer, I want to use environment variables for database configuration so that sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase.
6. As a developer, I want to use Prisma ORM to interact with the database so that I can ensure type safety and ease of use when working with the database.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Implement basic URL submission functionality
- [x] Update the form in `pages/index.tsx` to handle URL submission
- [x] Implement basic error handling for empty submissions

### 2. Set up API route for link ingestion
- [x] Create `/api/ingest` endpoint in `pages/api/ingest.ts`
- [x] Implement basic URL validation

### 3. Implement link type detection
- [x] Add function to detect link type (GitHub, YouTube, webpage)
- [x] Update API route to use link type detection

### 4. Set up Prisma and database connection
- [x] Configure Prisma schema for Link model
- [x] Set up database connection using environment variables
- [x] Create Prisma client instance
- [x] Update API route to store links in the database

### 5. Implement link storage in the database
- [x] Update API route to store processed links in the database
- [x] Handle potential database errors
- [x] Check for existing links before storing
- [x] Return appropriate responses for successful storage and errors

### 6. Improve error handling and user feedback
- [x] Enhance error messages in the API route
- [x] Update frontend to display detailed success/error messages to the user
- [x] Add loading state to prevent multiple submissions
- [x] Improve UI for status messages

## Future Enhancements (Post-P0)

- [ ] Implement actual processing logic for different link types
- [ ] Create an onboarding page for adding new link types
- [ ] Implement user authentication and personal knowledge bases
- [ ] Enhance the UI for a better user experience
- [ ] Implement pagination and search functionality for stored links

## Progress Tracking

As we complete each task, we'll update this document by checking off the completed items. We can also add notes or links to relevant pull requests for each completed task.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features and User Experience

### 1. User Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Set up NextAuth.js for authentication
- [ ] Implement sign-up and login functionality
- [ ] Create user profiles
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (admin, regular user)
- [ ] Secure API routes with authentication middleware

### 2. Pagination for Links Table
- [ ] Modify API to support pagination
- [ ] Update frontend to fetch paginated data
- [ ] Implement UI controls for navigating pages

### 3. Sorting and Filtering
- [ ] Add sorting functionality for link columns (URL, type, date added)
- [ ] Implement filtering options (by type, date range, etc.)
- [ ] Update API to handle sorting and filtering requests
- [ ] Create UI controls for sorting and filtering

### 4. Link Validation and Automatic Type Detection
- [ ] Implement URL validation on both frontend and backend
- [ ] Create a service to detect link type based on URL patterns
- [ ] Add visual indicators for link validity and type

### 5. Link Grouping and Tagging
- [ ] Design database schema for tags/groups
- [ ] Implement API for managing tags/groups
- [ ] Create UI for adding/editing tags or assigning links to groups
- [ ] Add filtering and viewing options based on tags/groups

### 6. Search Functionality
- [ ] Implement full-text search in the database
- [ ] Create a search API endpoint
- [ ] Develop a search input component with autocomplete
- [ ] Implement real-time search results as the user types

## Timeline and Milestones

1. Week 1-2: User Authentication and Authorization
2. Week 3: Pagination for Links Table
3. Week 4: Sorting and Filtering
4. Week 5: Link Validation and Automatic Type Detection
5. Week 6-7: Link Grouping and Tagging
6. Week 8: Search Functionality

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Implement unit tests for new components and functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for new features
- [ ] Perform manual testing and QA for each feature
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a small group of users

## Deployment and Monitoring

- [ ] Set up staging environment for testing features before production
- [ ] Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- [ ] Set up error logging and monitoring (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Monitor application performance and user engagement metrics

## Documentation

- [ ] Update API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] Create user guides for new features
- [ ] Maintain up-to-date developer documentation

## Review and Iteration

- [ ] Conduct code reviews for all new features
- [ ] Hold weekly progress meetings to discuss challenges and adjustments
- [ ] Gather user feedback and iterate on features as necessary

This development plan outlines the next phase of feature work for the Starbeam Link Manager. It provides a structured approach to implementing new features while maintaining code quality and user experience. The plan can be adjusted as needed based on priorities and feedback during the development process.
