# Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the core features of our link processing application.

## User Stories (P0 Goals)

1. As a user, I want to submit a URL to the system so that it can be processed and stored in my personal knowledge base system.
2. As a user, I want to see a confirmation message after submitting a link so that I know it was processed successfully.
3. As a user, I want the system to automatically detect the type of link I've submitted (GitHub, YouTube, or webpage) so that it can be processed appropriately.
4. As a developer, I need to add new link types with new processing rules easily over time. Preferably having an onboarding page for this process in the UI.
5. As a developer, I want to use environment variables for database configuration so that sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase.
6. As a developer, I want to use Prisma ORM to interact with the database so that I can ensure type safety and ease of use when working with the database.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Implement basic URL submission functionality
- [x] Update the form in `pages/index.tsx` to handle URL submission
- [x] Implement basic error handling for empty submissions

### 2. Set up API route for link ingestion
- [x] Create `/api/ingest` endpoint in `pages/api/ingest.ts`
- [x] Implement basic URL validation

### 3. Implement link type detection
- [x] Add function to detect link type (GitHub, YouTube, webpage)
- [x] Update API route to use link type detection

### 4. Set up Prisma and database connection
- [x] Configure Prisma schema for Link model
- [x] Set up database connection using environment variables
- [x] Create Prisma client instance
- [x] Update API route to store links in the database

### 5. Implement link storage in the database
- [x] Update API route to store processed links in the database
- [x] Handle potential database errors
- [x] Check for existing links before storing
- [x] Return appropriate responses for successful storage and errors

### 6. Improve error handling and user feedback
- [x] Enhance error messages in the API route
- [x] Update frontend to display detailed success/error messages to the user
- [x] Add loading state to prevent multiple submissions
- [x] Improve UI for status messages

## Future Enhancements (Post-P0)

- Implement actual processing logic for different link types
- Create an onboarding page for adding new link types
- Implement user authentication and personal knowledge bases
- Enhance the UI for a better user experience
- Implement pagination and search functionality for stored links
